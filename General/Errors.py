# Routines to calculate the mean square error for the Generalized Finite Difference methods. 2 ways are proposed to calculate the error:

#     \| e \|^2 = \left(\sqrt{\sum_{i} (u_{i}^{k} - U_{i}^{k})}\right) A_{i}

#     1.   The problem was solved in logically rectangular meshes.
#     2.   The problem was solved in triangulations or unstructured clouds of points.
